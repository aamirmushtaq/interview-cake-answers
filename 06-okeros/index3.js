QUESTION:

A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot
new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles
as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.

They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection
of two users' love rectangles. They suspect finding that 
intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so power
powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google
or Facebook or Obama or something.

Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of 
two given love rectangles.

As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight"
and never "diagonal". More rigorously: each side is parallel
with either the x-axis or the y-axis.

They are defined as objects like this:

*/

var myRectangle = {
//coordinates of bottom-left corner
leftX: 1,
bottomY: 1,

//width and height
width: 6,
height: 3
};
/*
Your output rectangle should use this format as well.

BREAKDOWN:

Let's break this problem into subproblems. How can we divide this
problem into smaller parts?

We could look at the two rectangles' horizontal overlap or
'x overlap' separately from their 'vertical overlap' or
'y overlap'.

Let's start with a helper function findXOverlap():

Since we're only working with the x dimension, we can treat
the two rectangles' widths as ranges on a 1-dimensional
number line.

What are the possible cases for how these ranges might overlap
or not overlap? Draw out some examples!

There are four relevant cases:

1.) The ranges partially overlap:
----
  ----

2.) One range is completely contained in the other:
    ---
   ------

3. The ranges don't overlap:
----
      ----

4. the ranges touch a single point:
---
   ----

Let's start with the first 2 cases. How do we compute the
overlapping range?

One of our ranges start "further to the right" than the other.
We don't know ahead of time which one it is, but we can check
the starting points of each range to see which one has the
highestStartPoint. That highestStartPoint is always the left-hand
side of the overlap, if there is one.

Not convinced? Draw some examples!

Similarly, the right-hand side of our overlap is always the 
lowestEndPoint. That may or may not be the end point of the 
same input range that had the highestStartPoint -- compare
cases(1) and (2).

This gives us our x overlap! So we can handle cases(1) and
(2). 


How do we know when there is no overlap?

If highestStartPoint > lowestEndPoint, the two rectangles
do not overlap.

But be careful - is it just greater than or is it greater
than or equal to?

It depends how we want to handle case(4) above.

If we use greater than, we treat case (4) as an overlap.
This means we could end up returning a rectangle with
zero width... which may or may not be what we're looking for.

You could make an argument either way.

Let's say a rectangle with zero width (or zero height) isn't
a rectangle at all, so we should treat that case as
"no intersection".

Can you finish findXOverlap() ?

Here's one way to do it:
*/

function findXOverlap(x1, width1, x2, width2) {
  //find the highest ("rightmost") start point and lowest ("leftmost") endpoint
  var highestStartPoint = Math.max(x1, x2);
  var lowestEndPoint = Math.min(x1 + width1, x2 + width2)

  //return null overlap if there is no overlap
  if (highestStartPoint >= lowestEndPoint) {
  return {startPoint: null, width: null};
}

//compute the overlap width
var overlapWidth = lowestEndPoint - highestStartPoint;

return {startPoint: highestStartPoint, width: overlapWidth};
}

/*
How can we adapt this for the rectangles' y's and height's?

Can we just make one findRangeOverlap() function that can handle
x overlap and y overlap?

Yes, we simply use more general parameter names:
*/

function findRangeOverlap(point1, length1, point2, length2) {
/*
find the highest start point and the lowest end point.
the highest ("rightmost" or "upmost") start point is the start
point of the overlap.

the lowest end point is the end point of the overlap.
*/

  var highestStartPoint = Math.max(point1, point2);
  var lowestEndPoint = Math.min(point1 + length1, point2 + length2);

  //return null overlap if there is no overlap
  if (highestStartPoint >= lowestEndPoint) {
    return {startPoint: null, overlapLength: null};
  }

  //compute the overlap length
  var overlapLength = lowestEndPoint - highestStartPoint;
  return {startPoint: highestStartPoint, overlapLength: overlapLength}
}
/*

We've solved our subproblem of finding the x and y overlaps! Now we just
need to put the results together.

SOLUTION:

We divide the problem into two halves:

1. The intersection along the x-axis
2. The intersection along the y-axis

Both problems are basically the same as finding the intersection of
two "ranges" on a 1 dimensional number line.

So we write a helper function findRangeOverlap() that can be used to find
both the x overlap and the y overlap, and we use it to build the
rectangular overlap:
*/


function findRectangularOverlap(rect1, rect2) {
  //get the x and y overlap points and lengths
  var xOverlap = findRangeOverlap(rect1.leftx, rect1.width, rect2.leftx, rect2.width);
  var yOverlap = findRangeOverlap(rect1.bottomY, rect1.height, rect2.bottomY, rect2.height);

  //return null rectangle if there is no overlap
  if(!xOverlap.overlapLength || !yOverlap.overlapLength) {
    return {
      leftX: null,
      bottomY: null,
      width: null,
      height: null,
    }
  };

  return {
    leftX: xOverlap.startPoint,
    bottomY: yOverlap.startPoint,
    width: xOverlap.overlapLength,
    height: yOverlap.overlapLength,
  }
}

/*COMPLEXITY

O(1) TIME AND O(1) SPACE

WHAT WE LEARNED:

This is an interesting one because the hard part isn't the time or space
optimization - it's geting something that works and is readable.

For problems like this, I often see candidates who can describe the 
strategyu at a high level but trip over themselves when they get into
the details.

Don't let it happen to you. To keep your thoughts clear and avoid bugs,
take time to: 

1. Think up and draw out all the possible case. Like we did with the
ways range can overlap.
2. Use very specific and descriptive variable names.*/
