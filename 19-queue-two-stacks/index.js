//COmplexity: enqueue is clearly O(1)
//And so is dequeue when outstack has items.

// Dequeue on an empty outStack is order of the numbers
// of items in inStack at that moment which can vary
//significantly

//Notice that the more expensive a dequeue 
//on an empty outStack is (that is, the more items 
//we have to move from inStack to outStack), the
// more O(1)O(1)-time dequeues off of a non-empty 
//outStack it wins us in the future.
