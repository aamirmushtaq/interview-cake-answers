/*
Write a function to see if a binary tree is
"superbalanced" (a new tree property we made up)

A tree is superbalanced if the difference between
the depths of any two leaf nodes is no greater
than one.

Rephrase that as:
  1. "The difference between the min leaf depth
  and the max leaf depth is 1 or less"

  2. "there are at most two distinct leaf depths,
  and they are at most 1 apart"
